                <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to
                    give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a
                    table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of
                    content? A
                    navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will
                    introduce
                    the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
                    HTML.</p>

                <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at
                    least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it
                    and
                    consuming content).</p>

                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the
                    web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                    consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of
                    content
                    to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
                    connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of
                    text:</p>
                <code class="example-code">My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    a
                    paragraph (<code>&lt;p></code>) element:</p>
                <code class="example-code">&lt;p>My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p></code>

                    alt="An sample code demonstrating html element's structure">
                <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for
                        paragraph),
                        wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins
                        or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                    <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph
                        text.</li>
                    <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                        slash
                        before the
                        element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common
                        beginner
                        error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that
                    our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a
                    <code>&lt;strong></code> element, which means that the
                    word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
                </p>
                <code class="example-code">
                    &lt;p>My cat is &lt;strong>very&lt;/strong> grumpy.&lt;/p>
                </code>
                <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the
                    <code>&lt;p></code> element first, then opened the
                    <code>&lt;strong></code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the
                    <code>&lt;strong></code> element first, before closing the
                    <code>&lt;p></code>.

        <section class="main-section" id="Block_vs_inline_elements">
            <header>Block vs inline elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: <b>block-level</b> elements and
                    <b>inline</b>
                    elements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Block-level</b> elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a
                        new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element
                        also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page.
                        For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation
                        menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it
                        might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                    <li><b>Inline</b> elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts
                        of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element
                        will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example
                        an <code>&lt;a></code> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such
                        as <code>&lt;em></code> or
                        <code>&lt;strong></code> create emphasis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consider the following example:</p>
                <code class="example-code">
                    &lt;em>first&lt;/em>&lt;em>second&lt;/em>&lt;em>third&lt;/em><br><br>
                    &lt;p>fourth&lt;/p><br>
                    &lt;p>fifth&lt;/p><br>
                    &lt;p>sixth&lt;/p><br>
                </code>
                <p><code>&lt;em></code> is an inline element. As you see below, the first three
                    elements sit on the same line, with no space in between. On the other hand,
                    <code>&lt;p></code> is a block-level element. Each
                    <code>&lt;p></code> element appears on a new
                    line, with space above and below. (The spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser
                    applies to
                    paragraphs.)
                </p>

            <article>
                <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements
                    consist
                    of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements
                    are
                    called void elements. For example, the <code>&lt;img></code> element embeds an
                    image file onto a page:</p>
                <code class="example-code">
                    &lt;img<br>
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" />
                </code>
                <p>This would output the following:</p>
                <div class="output-div">
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
                        alt="Firefox icon" />
                </div>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <article>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                <img class="sample-code-img"
                    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                    alt="A sample code of an element with a class attribute">
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this
                    example, the <code>class</code> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with
                    style
                    information.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A space between</b> it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute,
                        the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                    <li><b>The attribute name</b>, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li><b>An attribute value</b>, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another example of an element is <code>&lt;a></code>. This stands for
                    anchor. An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of
                    attributes, but several are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="attributes-list">
                    <li> <code>href</code>: This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example:
                        <code>href="https://www.mozilla.org/"</code>
                    </li>
                    <li> <code>title</code>: This attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a
                        description of the page that is being linked to. For example,
                        <code>title="The Mozilla homepage"</code>. This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over
                        the element.
                    </li>
                    <li> <code>target</code>: This attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link.
                        For example, <code>target="_blank"</code> will display the link in a new tab. If you want to
                        display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements
                    combine to form an entire HTML page:</p>
                <code class="example-code">
                    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en-US">

        &lt;meta charset="utf-8" />
        &lt;title>My test page&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;p>This is my page&lt;/p>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>
                </code>
                <p>Here we have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were
                        meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good
                        HTML. More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for
                        everything else to work right. That is all you need to know!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;html>&lt;/html></code>: This element wraps all the content on the page. It is
                        sometimes known as the root element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;head>&lt;/head></code>: This element acts as a container for everything you want to
                        include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes
                        keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content,
                        character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the
                        series.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"></code>: This element represents metadata that cannot be
                        represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <code>&lt;base></code>,
                        <code>&lt;link></code>, <code>&lt;script></code>, <code>&lt;style></code>,
                        <code>&lt;title></code>. The <code>charset</code> attributes sets the character set for your
                        document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written
                        languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain.
                        There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;title>&lt;/title></code>: This sets the title of the page, which is the title that
                        appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the
                        page when it is bookmarked.

                <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making
                    comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code
                    to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away
                    for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as
                    different people are making changes and updates.</p>
                <p>To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <code>&lt;!--</code> and
                    <code>--&gt;</code>. For example:
                </p>
                <code class="example-code">
                    <pre>&lt;p>I'm not inside a comment&lt;/p>

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- &lt;p>I am!&lt;/p> --&gt;</span></pre>
                </code>
                <p>As you can see below, only the first paragraph is displayed in the live output.</p>
                <div class="output-div">
                    <pre><p>I'm not inside a comment</p>
                    <!-- <p>I am!</p> --></pre>
                </div>
